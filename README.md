# K8s-secret-syncer

K8s-Secrets-syncer is a [Kubernetes operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) developed
using [the Kubebuilder framework](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) that keeps the values of Kubernetes
Secrets synchronised to secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.

This mapping is described in a Kubernetes custom resource called SyncedSecret. The operator polls AWS for changes in
secret values at regular intervals, and upon detecting changes, updates the Kubernetes Secrets.

__WARNING__: updating the value of a secret in AWS SecretsManager will override secrets in Kubernetes, therefore
 can be a destructive action.

## Comparison to existing projects

K8s-secret-syncer is similar to other projects such as:
 * [Kubernetes external secrets](https://github.com/godaddy/kubernetes-external-secrets)
 * [AWS secret operator](https://github.com/mumoshu/aws-secret-operator)

K8s-secret-syncer improves on this approach: 
 * uses [caching](#caching) to only retrieve the value of secrets when they have changed, substantially reducing
 [costs](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/pricing/) when syncing a large number of secrets.
 * enables sophisticated access control to secrets in AWS SecretsManager using IAM roles - see our
 [security model](#security-model)
 * supports [templated fields](#templated-fields) for Kubernetes secrets - enabling the use of values from multiple AWS
 SecretsManager secrets in one Kubernetes Secret

## Defining mapping between an AWS SecretsManager secret and a Kubernetes Secret

The following resource will map the AWS Secret ```secretsyncer/secret/sample``` to the Kubernetes Secret
```demo-service-secret```, and copy all key-value pairs from the AWS SecretsManager secret to the  Kubernetes secret For
 this example, the AWS SecretsManager secret needs to be a valid JSON consisting only of key-value pairs.

To access the secrets, k8s-secret-syncer will assume the role ```iam_role``` to poll the secret. Note: that role must be
 assumed by the Kubernetes cluster/node where the operator runs, eg part of the kube2iam annotation on the namespace.

```
apiVersion: secrets.contentful.com/v1
kind: SyncedSecret
metadata:
  name: demo-service-secret
  namespace: secret-sync
spec:
  IAMRole: iam_role
  dataFrom:
    secretMapRef:
      name: secretsyncer/secret/sample
```

If you only need to retrieve select keys in a single AWS secret, or multiple keys from different AWS secrets, you
can use the following syntax:

```
apiVersion: secrets.contentful.com/v1
kind: SyncedSecret
metadata:
  name: demo-service-secret
  namespace: secret-sync
spec:
  IAMRole: iam_role
  data:
    # Sets the key mysql_user for the Kubernetes Secret "demo-service-secret" to "contentful"
    - name: mysql_user
      value: "contentful"
    # Takes the value for key "password" from the Secrets Manager secret "mysql", assign to the
    # key "mysql_pw" of the Kubernetes secret "demo-service-secret"
    - name: mysql_pw
      secretKeyRef:
        name: mysql
        key: password
    - name: datadog_access_key
      secretKeyRef:
        name: datadog
        key: access_key
```


## [Templated fields](#templated-fields)

K8s-secret-syncer supports templated fields. This allows, for example, to iterate over a list of secrets that
share the same tag, to output a configuration file, such as in the following example:

```
apiVersion: secrets.contentful.com/v1
kind: SyncedSecret
metadata:
  name: pgbouncer.txt
  namespace: secret-sync
spec:
  IAMRole: iam_role
  data:
    - name: pgbouncer-hosts
      valueFrom:
        template: |
          {{- $cfg := "" -}}
          {{- range $secretID, $_ := filterByTagKey .Secrets "tag1" -}}
            {{- $secretValue := getSecretValue $secretID -}}
            {{- $cfg = printf "%shost=%s user=%s password=%s\n" $cfg $secretValue.host $secretValue.user $secretValue.password -}}
          {{- end -}}
          {{- $cfg -}}
```

This iterates over all secrets k8s-secret-syncer has access to, select those that have the tag "tag1" set,
and for each of these, add a configuration line to $cfg. $cfg is then assigned to the key "pgbouncer-hosts" of
the Kubernetes secret pgbouncer.txt.

The template is a [Go template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) with the following elements defined:
 * .Secrets - a map containing all listed secrets (without their value)
 * filterByTagKey - a helper function to filter the secrets by tag
 * getSecretValue - will retrieve the value of a Secret in SecretsManager, given its secret ID

## [Caching](#caching)

K8s-secret-syncer maintains both the list of AWS Secrets as well as their values in cache. The list is updated every
`POLL_INTERVAL_SEC`, and values are retrieved whenever their VersionID changed.

## [Security model](#security-model)

By default, k8s-secret-syncer will use the Kubernetes node's IAM role to list and retrieve the secrets. However, when
synced secrets have an IAMRole field defined, k8s-secret-syncer will assume that role before retrieving the secret. This
implies that the role specified by IAMRole can be assumed by the role of the Kubernetes node secret-syncer runs on.

To ensure a specific namespace only has access to the secrets it needs to, k8s-secret-syncer will use the
"iam.amazonaws.com/allowed-roles" annotation on the namespace (originally used by kube2iam) to validate that this
role can be assumed for that namespace.

The secret synchronisation will be allowed if:
 * the annotation is set on the namespace and contains the secrets IAMRole
 * no annotation is set on the namespace and the secret has a IAMRole set
 * no annotation is set on the namespace and the secret has no IAMRole set

The secret sync will be denied if:
 * the annotation is set on the namespace and does not contains the secrets IAMRole
 * the annotation is set on the namespace and the secret has no IAMRole set
